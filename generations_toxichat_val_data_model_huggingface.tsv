 We were talking about the climate change protests going on, and while trying to explain it to her what it was about, she just said “it’s God’s will, there’s nothing that can be done about it.” And while yes she’s right about it being gods will, how can I explain that there CAN be something done about it, and to not disregard the protests lol. <|endoftext|>Ask her the rhetorical question if you see a cat drowning in a pool and is in its last breath, should you help it or should you let ""Allah's will"" manifest?<|endoftext|>"	<|listener|>	<|encouraging|>	Haha!

 I am pretty equally attracted to both genders in many ways. Have been in long term relationships with both. However, about a month after a relationship starts my desire for sex fizzles and I am perfectly content with just snuggles and cuddling. I’m still completely in love with my partner but I don’t seem to need that connection.
