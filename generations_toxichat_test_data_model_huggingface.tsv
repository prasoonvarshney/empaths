 He may be slightly unattractive when Hulk and Rocket first see him but when he summons Mjolnir and Stormbreaker he looks so fucking badass. I say with genuine honestly this version is Thor is better than dyed eyebrows from Thor 1. The look from Avengers up to Ragnarok. This is by far my favorite look of Thor even further than Thor with short hair and an eyepatch. <|endoftext|>It’s just so obviously a fat suit and it only gives him a stomach, the rest of his body looks fit.

He looks like he could be a street performer but he is just a regular sized man.  He is just so much bulkier than the rest of the cast.	16.220778272078793	0.0009375602239742875	0.00010236679372610524	0.0001762335596140474	0.00010752577509265393	0.00019227369921281934	0.00013906683307141066

 Faith is the belief in the unseen or unknowable (God). It is not the belief in something that is demonstrably false: flat earth, global flood, 7000 year old earth. Belief in those things is just a delusion. <|endoftext|>Why do you respect that belief?
