 Hey guys, I was wondering what you thought of John Oliver's ""Equal Rights Amendment"" video. Knowing his penchant for only giving half-truths or conveniently omitting certain facts that don't support his rants, I didn't want to immediately believe every word he said. That said, is he being 100% honest and truthful about the ERA? Is he omitting certain facts about it? What's the real story behind it? Link here. <|endoftext|>Who gives a shit what John Oliver has to say, about anything. He can piss off back to Britain. <|endoftext|>Exactly, why should I give a fuck about the opinion of a foreign piece of shit.<|endoftext|>"	<|listener|>	<|encouraging|>	I guess because you're a British person.
